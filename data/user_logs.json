Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support. Delegate tasks if possible, and remember to take breaks and practice self-care. You don't have to carry the burden alone.",

Here are a few things you can try to help you concentrate: 1) Take a break and do something that relaxes you, like going for a walk or listening to music. 2) Write down your feelings in a journal to help you process them. 3) Talk to someone you trust about what's going on, like a family member, teacher, or counselor. 4) Try to focus on the task at hand and remind yourself that your studies are important for your future. 5) If you're still struggling, consider reaching out to your friend to try and resolve the issue, or give yourself permission to table the conversation until a later, less stressful time.",
